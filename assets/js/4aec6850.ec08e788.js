The following example shows how to prove that if p implies q and q implies r, then p implies r. We accomplish that by showing that the negation is unsatisfiable.

In this example, conjecture is an alias for the conjecture we want to prove.","sidebar":"smtlibSidebar"},"logic/Quantifiers":{"id":"logic/Quantifiers","title":"Quantifiers","description":"Z3 is a decision procedure for the combination of the previous quantifier-free theories. That is, it can answer whether a quantifier-free formula, modulo the theories referenced by the formula, is satisfiable or whether it is unsatisfiable. Z3 also accepts and can work with formulas that use quantifiers. It is no longer a decision procedure for such formulas in general (and for good reasons, as there can be no decision procedure for first-order logic).","sidebar":"smtlibSidebar"},"logic/Recursive Functions":{"id":"logic/Recursive Functions","title":"Recursive Functions","description":"SMTLIB2 standard: Page 62","sidebar":"smtlibSidebar"},"logic/Uninterpreted-functions-and-constants":{"id":"logic/Uninterpreted-functions-and-constants","title":"Uninterpreted Functions and Constants","description":"The basic building blocks of SMT formulas are constants and functions.

While these heuristic combinations tend to be highly tuned for known classes of problems, they may easily perform very badly on new classes of problems.

In many cases, changes to the solver heuristics can make a tremendous difference.","sidebar":"smtlibSidebar"},"strategies/probes":{"id":"strategies/probes","title":"Probes","description":"Probes (aka formula measures) are evaluated over goals.
