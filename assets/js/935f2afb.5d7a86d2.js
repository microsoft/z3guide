Z3 supports the usual Boolean operators and, or, xor, not, => (implication), ite (if-then-else). Bi-implications are represented using equality =. The following example shows how to prove that if p implies q and q implies r, then p implies r. We accomplish that by showing that the negation is unsatisfiable. The command define-fun is used to define a macro (aka alias). In this example, conjecture is an alias for the conjecture we want to prove.","sidebar":"smtlibSidebar"},"logic/Quantifiers":{"id":"logic/Quantifiers","title":"Quantifiers","description":"Z3 is a decision procedure for the combination of the previous quantifier-free theories. That is, it can answer whether a quantifier-free formula, modulo the theories referenced by the formula, is satisfiable or whether it is unsatisfiable. Z3 also accepts and can work with formulas that use quantifiers. It is no longer a decision procedure for such formulas in general (and for good reasons, as there can be no decision procedure for first-order logic).","sidebar":"smtlibSidebar"},"logic/Recursive Functions":{"id":"logic/Recursive Functions","title":"Recursive Functions","description":"SMTLIB2 standard: Page 62","sidebar":"smtlibSidebar"},"logic/Uninterpreted-functions-and-constants":{"id":"logic/Uninterpreted-functions-and-constants","title":"Uninterpreted Functions and Constants","description":"The basic building blocks of SMT formulas are constants and functions.

Z3 can produce models for satisfiable formulas. Yet in many cases arbitrary models are insufficient and applications are really solving optimization problems: one or more values should be minimal or maximal. When there are multiple objectives, they should be combined using Pareto fronts, lexicographic priorities, or optimized independently. This section describes a feature exposed by Z3 that lets users formulate objective functions directly with Z3. Under the hood is a portfolio of approaches for solving linear optimization problems over SMT formulas, MaxSMT, and their combinations.","sidebar":"smtlibSidebar"},"optimization/softconstraints":{"id":"optimization/softconstraints","title":"Soft Constraints","description":"The (assert-soft formula [id id]) command asserts a weighted soft constraint.

In many cases, changes to the solver heuristics can make a tremendous difference.","sidebar":"smtlibSidebar"},"strategies/probes":{"id":"strategies/probes","title":"Probes","description":"Probes (aka formula measures) are evaluated over goals.
