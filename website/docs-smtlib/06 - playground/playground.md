Run Z3 on SMTLIB on the web! 

```z3 always-editable
(echo "Type here and press render to run z3 on your SMTLIB formulas") 
```

import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';

<CodeBlock language="lisp">
(echo "Type here and press render to run z3 on your SMTLIB formulas")
</CodeBlock>

<!-- We need to have a capability that allows the user to choose the python api or just z3 -->
